        <div id="aboutParagraph">  
        <p>Born and raised in <strong>Waterloo, ON</strong>, Megan enjoys everything the city has to offer especially the startup culture, the University of Waterloo and all the coffee shops! However, one of her favourite things to do lies outside of this city...<strong>travelling!</strong> Ever since she was two years old when she went on her first trip to Walk Disney World, she loves to fly and visit brand new places that she has never been to before. There is so much of the world left to discover for her and she wants to visit as many places in her lifetime that she can!</p>

        <p> There are a few other trips that she has been on before 2013, however she wanted to include the most recent ones! To go further in depth, the trips that she rated 10/10 will be further explained about what made them so great (Also to give others some ideas of where they should travel next)!</p> 
        
        <p>Starting off with her trip to the <strong>West Coast of Canada</strong>! This was her very first time travelling to this part of Canada, and she instantly fell in love with it from the moment she saw the mountains from the plane window. It's a wonderful place to travel if you love the outdoors! So many of her highlights of the trip involved hiking and simply being in nature. Lake Louise was a beautiful destination with the crystal clear blue water and the mountains in the background. A great place to visit for a nature photographer! All in all, visiting Banff and Vancouver is highly recommended by her.</p>
        
        <p>Next, there is her trip to <strong>San Francisco</strong>. Now this is a destination that Megan could see herself living in one day. The main reason being that on one side of the golden gate bridge is the hustle of the downtown city life, but just across the bridge you are in the mountains near a beach. The best of both worlds, so close together! She always needs a balance of busy city and calm nature in a place that she might live in one day. San Fran definitely is a possibility. A great spot with beautiful landscapes and a ton of tourist things to do such as Alcatraz and Fisherman's Wharf. She would recommend staying there for atleast a week, since there is so much to see and do!</p>
        
        <p>The last trip that deserved a 10/10 for her, was her trip to <strong>Orlando</strong>! This trip was a special one because this was a trip with her entire dance company as they got the opportunity to dance in one of Walt Disney World's parades at Magic Kingdom! She got to stay on Disney's exclusive resort for cast members and got a behind the scenes look in Magic Kingdom. It was a once in a lifetime trip! The weather was perfect and she got a bunch of free time in all the Disney parks. The best thing about going to Disney is that your trip will always be magical!</p>
